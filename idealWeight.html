                    Being overweight is hard on your heart. It increases your
                    risk of having heart disease, a stroke, high cholesterol,
                    high blood pressure, and diabetes. Choosing heart-healthy
                    foods and getting regular exercise will help you achieve and
                    maintain a healthy weight. Also, find ways to reduce stress,
                    which affects energy and hunger and, if chronic, can make
                    your body store more fat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If your doctor diagnosed you with overweight or obesity,
                    it’s important to follow their recommendations for losing
                    weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of
                    your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a
                    loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower
                    triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as
                    your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3%
                    to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings,
                    lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL
                    cholesterol.

                    If you need to lose weight, connecting with others can help
                    keep you on track. Try these:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Join a weight loss program with a buddy.</li>
                    <li>
                      Sign “social support” agreements with three family members
                      or friends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Get your kids involved. Explain that it's important to sit
                      less and move more to stay at a healthy weight and that
                      they’ll have more energy to ride a bike or shoot hoops.
                      Tell them you’ll do the same.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
