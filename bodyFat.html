      Skinfold calipers offer an inexpensive way to measure body fat. They’re
      relatively easy to use and especially helpful for measuring body fat
      levels when other methods that require expensive equipment or specialized
      training are unavailable.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 19px">
      These handheld tools pinch and measure the thickness of subcutaneous
      (under the skin) fat in multiple areas of the body, including the abdomen,
      triceps, and thigh.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 19px">
      It’s typically recommended to use a 7-site measurement method when using
      skin calipers, which involves taking skinfold measurements from 7 areas of
      the body. However, 8-site and 3-site measurements can be used as well .
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 19px">
      The 7-site measurements are all taken on the same side of the body and
      include:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 19px">
      <li>triceps</li>
      <li>under the shoulder blade</li>
      <li>chest</li>
      <li>midaxillary (near the armpit)</li>
      <li>above the hip</li>
      <li>abdomen</li>
      <li>thigh</li>
    </ul>
