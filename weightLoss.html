    <h2 class="mt-0">What is healthy weight loss?</h2>
    <p>
      It’s natural for anyone trying to lose weight to want to lose it very
      quickly. But people who lose weight gradually and steadily (about 1 to 2
      pounds per week) are more successful at keeping weight off. Healthy weight
      loss isn’t just about a “diet” or “program”. It’s about an ongoing
      lifestyle that includes healthy eating patterns and regular physical
      activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’ve achieved a healthy weight, rely on healthy eating and physical
      activity to help you keep the weight off over the long term.
    </p>

      Losing weight is not easy, and it takes commitment. But if you’re ready to
      get started, we’ve got a step-by-step guide to help get you on the road to
      weight loss and better health.
